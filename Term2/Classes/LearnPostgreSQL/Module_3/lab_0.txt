This covers developing and understanding stored functions in PostgreSQL using PL/pgSQL.

Starting from zero, learners will first set up the environment, create basic functions (e.g., hello_world, safe_divide), and explore how PostgreSQL stores and executes these functions at runtime, including parsing, planning, and caching.

Next, we dive into advanced parameter modes (IN, OUT, INOUT), variable declaration and scoping, and memory context management

Finally, we master control-flow constructs (IF, CASE, FOR, FOREACH, WHILE), exception handling for robust error management, and both implicit and explicit cursors for row-by-row processing, all while understanding the underlying PL/pgSQL interpreter mechanics, memory contexts, and execution plans.
